# GeneticMutations

This project hasn't been modified since last year for the sake of nostalgia.
It's like an old library to me where I can see what I was capable of a year ago and compare it with
what I know now.

The only thing I changed was that I disabled nullables lol (the first sign of improvement over the course
of the year, now I actually have knowledge of these things and don't just ignore the warnings).

Enjoy I guess. Hope it works as well as I remember it did.
